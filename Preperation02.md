  **These are cool facts about Nick Scholl**
  
  * I usually go by Nick but if you want to get formal/professional I can do Nicholas.  I will do my best to spell it phonetically *[NIK] + [UH] + [LUHS]* or *[NIK]*
  * I go by He/Him/His pronouns

  *   This is a photo of me after a run in the winter, it was so cold that my sweat froze on my beard hair.  I chose this photo because running has been a part of my life, I did cross country and track and hated it but now I do it for me and I really enjoy it.  I chose it because this photo always makes me laugh and reminds me that yes you *CAN* run in the winter.
  *   I am a graduate student, I got my undegrad in Mathematics and a minor in finance.
  *   What I am hoping to do after getting my masters degree is go into data science and analytics.
  *   I am in STA 518 to essentially learn R.  R and python are described as the two big languages to learn for data science.  A big debate for some reason is to ask *should you learn python OR R for data science?* [Here is some evidence](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/python-vs-r)  and I figured if I learned both that would set me up nicely for the career I am hoping to get.  I learned in my internship of undergrad that I love data, I love math and I love doing analysis on data and this class fit perfectly in helping me acheive that.
  *   Yeah I do know some people that do what I would like to do for a job.  Her name is Tina Huang and she posts a lot on youtube.  They do share their work on github but it looks like they do most of their work in pyhton. [Here is a link to her video about analyzing comment sections](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHOVWiZKpHM&list=PLVD3APpfd1tuZG0pek_JaPYRhGwpJj3Jd).  What she is doing here is analzying the comment section for positive and negative comments and seeing what the most commons words were, amount of them and any insight we can get from them.  What I like about her is she is very friendly to beginners or people on the outside of data science and talks a lot about her journey becoming a data scientist and how to get started in the field.
